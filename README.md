## Moments: Interactive Map-Based Data Capture

Moments is a groundbreaking wildlife data collection trool inspired by the two greatest current obstacles in research; the absence of in-software visualization tools and the inability to capture complex relationships between data. My software features an political or physical maps, on which researchers can input wildlife species locations and connect them to form interactions. In addition to facilitating data visualization and input, Moments also features novel data storage and sharing features, allowing data to be exported in spreadsheet, map-image, and notes forms. 

This tool was written entirely in QML and tested through Qt Creator, although I also worked closely with CyberTracker Conservation's Justin Steventon to develop a C++ platform to support data storage and classification. Moments has been and is actively used and tested in field research by teams from the Mara Lion Conservation Programme in Kenya's Maasai Mara Reserve and from Lion Landscapes in the Loisaba and Samburu Conservancies. 

The full version of Moments is projected to be released in late-summer 2019; in the meantime, contact me at brandonznyc@gmail.com for software demos, consulting sessions, and/or testing instructions. 

# Interactive UI from Start to Finish

Moments's most valuable concept is its easy-of-use. There are no selection or input screens -- all of the data input occurs in the centralized map page. Built using an ESRI-supported backend, Moments offers the complete set of map tools and features, giving researchers full control over:

1) Map Selection: We allow users to choose from political, physical, and contour map baselayers during setup.
2) Data Input: User-inputted data is stored as geographical coordinates, which are also displayed on their screens as a ESRI geospatial reference. 
3) Map and Data Visualization: Once users are finished recording, the "moment" is saved as a .png file for immediate access in-app or easy integration into research presentations. 


# General Purpose Specialized for Wildlife Interactions

Moments fulfills the same data-input capabilities that standard tools possess, yet data collection has shown to be significantly more efficient on our app. With most touch-based controls on one screen, researchers can create, input, and save a wildlife sighting without stopping their vehicle.  

In addition to supporting individual data points, Moments also allows for data points to be connected through interactions. Like the individual points, interactions are color-coded and appear as a separate column in spreadsheets as well as dotted lines in maps. This allows researchers to describe locations of data both visually and numerically, a normally-complex feature automated through Moments.

# End-to-end Support of the Wildlife Research Pipeline

Moments offers unparalleled support for a research organization's entire data collection and usage pipeline, as it has been actively trialled and refined in active field research in two locations in Kenya's national parks and conservancies. When an organization partners with Moments, they receive:

1)Visual-based data collection tool effective regardless of user language or educational background
2)Unique data organization structure based on elements and fields; allows for easy separation and cleaning of data
3)Offline analysis channels, from traditional spreadsheet format to purely visual map-based. 
4)Easy export features to desktop or mobile camera roll, for further numerical analysis or direct inclusion into presentation format
5)Frequent communication and consultation with developer (me!) regarding Moments usage strategy, training, and future directions.
